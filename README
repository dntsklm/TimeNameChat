PHP chat server for simple networked CLI conversations

Requirements
============

PHP v5.4 (or possibly later) command-line interpreter for the server
and nc-like program for client connections to the server.

Client connection to the server may be established with any program
that may handle strings of ASCII text over network.

The used CLI option parser sgetopt() is at:
https://github.com/dntsklm/sgetopt
This program contains the stripped version of it.

Use
===

Overview
--------

First, chat server is run, optionally specifying interface and port
to listen on for client connections. The server reprints one line of
gauge information on STDERR. Second, clients connect to the server.

Roles
-----

Client may take a role of watcher or chatter.

### Watcher

Client becomes a watcher when successfully connects to the server.
Watcher receives all messages which happen on the server.

### Chatter

Watcher may join a conversation and become a chatter by submitting a
nickname at any time.

Chatting
--------

Server sends or relays messages to clients, connected to it, in real
time (instant messaging).

Server message sent to clients is composed in the format:

<message server time> [<server name>]: <message>

Chatter message relayed to clients is composed in the format:

<message server time> <messenger nickname>: <message>

To chat, write a string of ASCII text and hit Enter key for the
server to relay the text to all clients.

Example
=======

One of clients creates a server to chat on:

$ ./TimeNameChat.php -i <server IPv4> -p <server port>
Connections	Watchers	Chatters
#		#		#

That client connects to the server with program nc but does not
submit nickname -- chooses to just watch the conversation:

$ nc <server IPv4> <server port>

Another client connects with program ncat and submits nickname:

$ ncat <server IPv4> <server port>

And another client connects with program telnet and submits nickname:

$ telnet <server IPv4> <server port>
